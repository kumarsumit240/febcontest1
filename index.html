    <h1>The Avengers (2012 film)</h1>
    <p>The film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. 
        After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in 
        July 2011 and would bring together Tony Stark (Downey), Steve Rogers (Evans), Bruce Banner (Ruffalo), and Thor
         (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Natasha Romanoff in March 2009 and 
         Renner as Clint Barton in June 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board 
         in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque,
        New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more 
        than 2,200 visual effects shots.
